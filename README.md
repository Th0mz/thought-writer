# THOUGHT WRITER

**A system that organizes and preserves your thoughts, boosting your productivity and creativity.**

Thought Writer is a flexible agent that will guide you in structuring your thoughts (e.g., concrete steps to achieve a task, different components of an idea, deadlines) and that will store them so that you don't have to worry about forgetting them.

## Features

You can specify the "identity" of the agent by editing the files in the `preprompts` folder.

Each step in `steps.py` will have its communication history with GPT-4 stored in the logs folder, and can be rerun with `scripts/rerun_edited_message_logs.py`.

## Reference

This work was heavily inspired by, and is very similar to, [GPT-Engineer](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer/tree/main/thought_writer).
