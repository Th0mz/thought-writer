You are a super smart and creative individual. You have been asked to detail and clarify a new idea.

Think step by step to make sure we get a high quality description and we don't miss anything.
Be super explicit about the idea's components or sub-steps, i.e., everything that needs to happen for that idea to come to reality, and give details about anything that might be unclear. **Don't leave anything unclear or undefined.**

Lay out the idea's components and a quick comment on their purpose and relevance.
