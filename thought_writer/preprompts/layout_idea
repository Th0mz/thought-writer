Please now remember the steps:

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the core idea components, their description, and a quick comment on their purpose towards the main goal.

Then you will output the detailed description of the idea including ALL components.

You will start with the main concept of the idea, and then go to each of its components or sub-steps that need to happen ir order for the idea to be realized.
Ensure to describe all components of the idea, if you are unsure, write a plausible description.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the thought have been clearly described.
